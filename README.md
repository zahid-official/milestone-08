**Component State Management:** Manage state at the component level to handle dynamic changes in product information, user interactions, and other application states.

**Conditional Rendering:** Display different UI elements based on conditions, such as showing special offers, product details, or out-of-stock notifications dynamically.

**useState Hook:** Utilize React’s useState hook to handle state changes in functional components, such as toggling between product views or storing user preferences.

**useEffect Hook:** Manage side-effects in functional components, such as fetching product data or performing updates when certain variables change.

**Props Validation:** Use PropTypes to validate the data being passed to components, ensuring that all required props are provided and in the correct format.

**Props Drilling:** Pass data down through multiple levels of components using props, allowing for effective communication between parent and child components.

**Lifting State Up:** Share state between components by lifting the state up to the closest common ancestor, improving component interaction and making the app more efficient.
